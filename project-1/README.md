# Project 1 - Unitycraft

## Preface

Minecraft holds a special place in my heart. It's what got me into engineering and much of my likes and hobbies I value are largely because of it. The power of a 3D sandbox lies in how it is the perfect environment for a child to unleash their creativity and mess around in an environment without negative repercussions compared to the real world.

The goal of this project is to find ways this popular sandbox can be improved. The following points will illustrate how some of the key mechanisms of Minecraft can be undesirable.

### Perception: 1st vs 3rd Person

### Simplicity: 3D vs 2D

### Performance/Accessibility
